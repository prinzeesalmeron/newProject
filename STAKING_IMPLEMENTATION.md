# ETH Staking Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete ETH staking system without any token dependencies. Users can stake native ETH directly to earn rewards.

---

## 🎯 What Was Created

### 1. Smart Contract (`contracts/Staking.sol`)

**Features:**
- ✅ **Native ETH Staking** - No token required, stake ETH directly
- ✅ **Multiple Pools** - 4 default pools with different lock periods and APYs
- ✅ **Flexible Rewards** - Claim rewards anytime without unstaking
- ✅ **Security** - ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, Ownable
- ✅ **Transparent** - All calculations done on-chain

**Default Pools:**
| Pool | Lock Period | APY | Max Capacity |
|------|-------------|-----|--------------|
| Flexible | No lock | 5% | 1000 ETH |
| 30 Days | 30 days | 8% | 500 ETH |
| 90 Days | 90 days | 12% | 300 ETH |
| 180 Days | 180 days | 15% | 200 ETH |

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
stake(uint256 poolId) payable          // Stake ETH in a pool
unstake(uint256 stakeId)               // Withdraw stake after lock period
claimRewards(uint256 stakeId)          // Claim pending rewards
calculateRewards(address, stakeId)     // Calculate pending rewards
depositRewards() payable               // Add ETH to rewards pool
```

### 2. Frontend Page (`src/pages/Staking.tsx`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive UI with dark mode
- ✅ Real-time stats dashboard
- ✅ Pool selection with APY comparison
- ✅ Active stakes management
- ✅ Rewards claiming interface
- ✅ Progress bars for pool utilization
- ✅ Lock period countdown

**User Flow:**
1. Connect wallet
2. Select staking pool
3. Enter ETH amount
4. View estimated yearly rewards
5. Stake ETH
6. Track active stakes
7. Claim rewards anytime
8. Unstake after lock period

---

### 3. Database Tables

Created three tables for tracking staking data:

#### `staking_pools`
Stores pool configurations
- Pool details (name, lock period, APY)
- Total staked and capacity tracking
- Active/inactive status

#### `user_stakes`
Tracks individual user stakes
- User and pool references
- Amount, timestamps, transaction hash
- Status tracking (active, unstaked)

#### `user_rewards`
Records reward claims
- Reward amounts and claim times
- Transaction hash tracking

**Security:**
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Users can only view/modify their own stakes
- ✅ Pool data is public read-only
- ✅ Authenticated access required

---

### 4. Deployment Script (`script/DeployStaking.s.sol`)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Deploy to testnet (Sepolia)
forge script script/DeployStaking.s.sol:DeployStaking \
  --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

# Deploy to mainnet
forge script script/DeployStaking.s.sol:DeployStaking \
  --rpc-url $MAINNET_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

The script:
- Deploys Staking contract
- Creates 4 default pools
- Optionally funds rewards pool with initial ETH
- Outputs all contract addresses

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Staking Flow

1. **User stakes ETH:**
   - Chooses a pool
   - Sends ETH to contract
   - Receives stake position

2. **Rewards accrue:**
   - Calculated per second based on APY
   - Formula: `(amount × APY × timeStaked) / (10000 × 365 days)`
   - No need to harvest, auto-compounding

3. **User claims rewards:**
   - Can claim anytime without unstaking
   - Updates last claim timestamp
   - Rewards sent directly to wallet

4. **User unstakes:**
   - Must wait for lock period to end
   - Claims pending rewards first
   - Returns principal + unclaimed rewards

---

## 💰 Economics

### Rewards Pool

The contract has a separate rewards pool funded by:
- Initial deposit by owner
- Anyone can contribute via `depositRewards()`
- Receives all ETH sent directly to contract

**Important:** The rewards pool must have sufficient ETH to pay rewards. Monitor and refill as needed.

### APY Calculation

APY is stored in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%):
- 500 = 5%
- 800 = 8%
- 1200 = 12%
- 1500 = 15%

Rewards are calculated:
```
rewards = (stakeAmount × APY × secondsStaked) / (10000 × 365 days)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **ReentrancyGuard** - Prevents reentrancy attacks
2. **Pausable** - Owner can pause in emergency
3. **Ownable** - Admin functions restricted to owner
4. **Lock Periods** - Enforced time locks per pool
5. **Capacity Limits** - Prevents over-staking in pools
6. **Safe Math** - Solidity 0.8.19+ automatic overflow protection

---

## 📊 Frontend Integration

### Required Updates

To integrate with smart contracts, update:

**1. Contract Address**
```typescript
// src/lib/config.ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  STAKING: '0xYourDeployedStakingAddress',
  // ... other contracts
};
```

**2. Contract ABI**
After deployment, export the ABI:
```bash
forge inspect Staking abi > src/lib/abis/Staking.json
```

**3. Contract Manager**
Add staking methods to `src/lib/blockchain/contractManager.ts`

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy contract to testnet
- [ ] Verify on Etherscan
- [ ] Fund rewards pool with test ETH
- [ ] Test staking in each pool
- [ ] Test rewards calculation
- [ ] Test claiming rewards
- [ ] Test unstaking after lock period
- [ ] Test early unstake prevention
- [ ] Test pause/unpause functionality
- [ ] Test emergency withdraw

### Testing with Sepolia

1. Get Sepolia ETH from faucet
2. Deploy contracts
3. Stake small amounts (0.01 ETH minimum)
4. Wait a few minutes for rewards to accrue
5. Test claiming and unstaking

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements

**Potential Features:**
- Compound rewards automatically
- NFT staking receipts
- Governance voting power based on stakes
- Liquid staking (stake and get tradeable token)
- Dynamic APY based on utilization
- Referral rewards
- Early unstake with penalty option

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No BlockToken dependency** - Uses native ETH only
2. **Rewards pool must be funded** - Monitor balance regularly
3. **Lock periods are enforced** - Users cannot unstake early
4. **Gas costs** - Each stake/unstake costs gas
5. **APY is not guaranteed** - Depends on rewards pool balance

---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] Audit smart contract code
- [ ] Test extensively on testnet
- [ ] Verify all calculations
- [ ] Set appropriate pool capacities
- [ ] Fund rewards pool adequately
- [ ] Test emergency procedures
- [ ] Update frontend with contract addresses
- [ ] Monitor initial stakes closely
- [ ] Have emergency pause procedure ready
